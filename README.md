# React Playground

I find myself looking for a fast compilation environment for testing out
some ideas related to React applications, and this boilerplate
application helps. I prefer using my editor instead of online JSBin and
JSFiddle.

Webpack dev server is included to get an autocompilation feature.
Customize `webpack.config.js` as per your preference.

This also includes an ESlint configuration based on the "standard"
styleguide + semicolons rule (via the "semistandard" config).

### Setup steps

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install --no-progress`
3. Start the application using `npm run start`
4. Visit http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/ (that trailing slash is required)
